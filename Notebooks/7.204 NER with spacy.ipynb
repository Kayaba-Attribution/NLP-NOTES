Apple typically unveils its new iPhones in September, but opted for a later date this year. \n","It has not said why, but it was widely speculated to be related to disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The firm's shares ended the day 2.7% lower. \n","This has been linked to reports that several Chinese internet platforms opted not to carry the livestream, \n","although it was still widely viewed and commented on via the social media network Sina Weibo.\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# upload NLP_syllabus_blog_post.txt to colab\n","from google.colab import files\n","uploaded = files.upload()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":73},"id":"QLHz9Zzx0evQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670437284167,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":10494,"user":{"displayName":"Tony Russell-Rose","userId":"17399005977012450970"}},"outputId":"0a6096d3-7843-4eb2-aaf5-49a428d8ec10"},"id":"QLHz9Zzx0evQ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","     <input type=\"file\" id=\"files-a30b45f4-f0ef-4011-977a-7b1da1f187eb\" name=\"files[]\" multiple disabled\n","        style=\"border:none\" />\n","     <output id=\"result-a30b45f4-f0ef-4011-977a-7b1da1f187eb\">\n","      Upload widget is only available when the cell has been executed in the\n","      current browser session.
